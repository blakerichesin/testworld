    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Low-mass galaxies provide a crucial means to test the predictions of cosmological models on small scales
      where they have frequently struggled to match observations. However, the most detailed comparisons have
      relied almost exclusively on the satellite galaxies in the Local Group (LG) as this was, until recently, the only
      system with a high level of completeness at low mass and surface brightness. Here we propose a complete
      census of ALL satellite galaxies (M_V < -9) within MW-like systems out to 10 Mpc. We request 149 orbits to
      image 149 of these satellites, as well as support to incorporate 111 targets with existing HST observations.
      Together these observations make up a volume-limited sample of 260 satellites around 22 MW-like hosts. This
      data set will allow an unbiased characterization of the properties of MW-like satellite systems and end our over-
      reliance on the LG as the one point of detailed comparison with simulations. Among many other science goals,
      the observations and analysis that we propose will allow: 1) the most robust measurement of the satellite
      luminosity function to date, 2) the determination of the globular cluster luminosity function in a lower galaxy
      mass regime than ever before, and 3) measurements of the star formation histories and quenching times of an
      unprecedented sample of satellites. Only in the past few years has a project of this scope become possible, as
      previously the target samples did not exist, and it is only possible with space-based observations. The data
      products of this program will be fundamental to all studies, both theoretical and observational, of low-mass
      satellites for the next decade or more.
